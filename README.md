# nix-playground

The nix-playground is a command line tool that makes applying patches to the nixpkgs packages much easier.

## Example

```bash
# checkout libnvidia-container package source code locally
# (in `nixpkgs` by default, a full pkg path with flake name can be provided like `nixpkgs#cowsay`)
np checkout libnvidia-container

# modify the code
vim checkout/src/cli/main.c

# build the package with changes you made in the checkout folder and try it out
np build

# output the patch for applying on the production environments
np patch > bugfix.patch

# clean up the generated files
np clean
```

## Why
Too often, we are afraid of digging into the upstream code, modifying and patching it because it's a very tedious process.
Just getting the project to build could take hours.
Thanks to [nixpkgs](https://nixos.org), building open-source software is much easier with a single source tree capable of building from the Linux kernel all the way to a simple utils command-line tool.
With nix-playground, now you can easily check out source code from a package, modify it, test it out, and then create patches effortlessly.

## Usage

This tool assumes you have [nixpkgs](https://nixos.org) with [flake](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes) and [Python](https://www.python.org) >= 3.11 installed on your environment.
To install nix-playground, simply run:

```bash
pip install nix-playground
```

Then, you can use the command line tool `np` (stands for nix-playground).
For example, say you need to apply a patch to [libnvidia-container](https://github.com/NVIDIA/libnvidia-container), with the `np` command, you can run:

```bash
np checkout nixpkgs#libnvidia-container
```

It will check the source code of `libnvidia-container` in the `checkout` folder of the current directory.
Next, you can modify the code in the `checkout` folder. The tool will track changes you made automatically.
Once you're done with the changes and would like to try it out, simply do the following:

```bash
np build
```

It will build the `libnvidia-container` package with patches from the changes you just made in the `checkout` folder.
The result will end up in the `result` folder, just like the `nix-build` command.
You can test the build. When you're happy with the result and decide to port the patch file to your production environments, you can run the command:

```bash
np patch > bugfix.patch
```

To print the patch file contents.
With the patch file, you can then apply it on the target package like this:

```nix
with import <nixpkgs> {};
    libnvidia-container.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: {
        patches = (lib.attrsets.attrByPath ["patches"] [] oldAttrs) ++ [./bugfix.patch];
    })
```

## How it works

### Checkout

1. Create `.nix-playground` folder in the current directory
2. Call `nix-instantiate` to generate the derivation for the target package with a link at `.nix-playground/der`
3. Get the `env.src` nix store path from the generated derivation 
4. Run `nix-store --realise` to realise the package and its source derivation with links in the `.nix-playground` folder.
5. Deep copy the source (from env.src) folder to the current directory's `checkout` folder
6. Init a git repo in the `checkout` folder and commit all the changes

### Build

1. Get the cached diff with git for the `checkout` folder and output the patch file to `.nix-playground/checkout.patch`
2. Run `nix-build --expr` with patch file applied to the target package

## Roadmap

- Add automatic tests
- Publish it to nixpkgs 
- Implement `np shell` (like `nix-shell` but with the patches applied)
- Support patching nested dependency package
- Rewrite it with Rust? 🤔
